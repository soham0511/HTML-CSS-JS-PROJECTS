# HTML-CSS-JS-PROJECTS
These projects are designed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.                                                                                                             
I have used the animations of CSS in the lamborghini animations project for the movement of car wheels and shaking of car body, and to move the hands of the clock in the analog clock project.
